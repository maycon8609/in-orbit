### About the project:
In Orbit is a habit tracker where you can create and monitor the progress of new habits throughout the week. Users can create and define how many times they want to perform a habit, and can also mark it as completed.

### Drizzle ORM:
"Itâ€™s the only ORM with both relational and SQL-like query APIs, providing you the best of both worlds when it comes to accessing your relational data. Drizzle is lightweight, performant, typesafe, non-lactose, gluten-free, sober, flexible and serverless-ready by design. Drizzle is not just a library, itâ€™s an experience. ðŸ¤©. BY: drizzle team"
